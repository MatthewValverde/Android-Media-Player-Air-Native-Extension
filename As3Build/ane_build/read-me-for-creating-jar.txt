When creating jar file in Eclipse:

Make sure your project is a checked as a Library project-- under properties/Android.

This will make sure that the resources are available in the AIR mobile app.

When exporting jar, exclude or uncheck the 'gen' directory which contains the BuildConfig.java and R.java classes.

If you do not exclude the 'gen' directory, you will recieve an error when packaging the AIR mobile app.
